     *  The default selection method is to cycle through the resources in the
     *  order in which they were RELEASED.
     *
     *  The idle resource set starts in the order the resouces were added to the
     *  resouce set and assumes that the first resource listed was the resource that
     *  was allocated the longest time in the past, and so on.  For example,
     *  if the set of idle resources has the following list:
     *
     *  Resource B
     *  Resource A
     *  Resource C
     *
     *  Then C was the most recently used, resource A the next most recently used, and
     *  resource B the oldest used.  Resource B will be next allocated, if it can
     *  satisfy the amount of the request. If not, Resource A will be checked, and so forth
     *  until a resource that can satisfy the request is found. Thus, it is entirely
     *  possible that B will not be the next recommended resource. The selected resource
     *  is added to the end of the list after it is released.
     *
     *  Note that the the order can vary with this list depending on the order in which the resources are
     *  released.  To provide alternative behavior either override
     *  this method, or provide a ResourceSelectionRuleIfc
     *
     *  The default behavior is to return the first available resource
     *  that can fully supply the amount needed
